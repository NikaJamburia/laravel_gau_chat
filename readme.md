<h1>Description</h1>
<p>In this application you can register and add other registered users to your friend and then chat with them. It's similar to Facebooks messenger. It's not finished yet. I haven't added the feature of sending friend requests yet. There is only one chat in the database right now, but it works properly. You can send and recieve messages and also check if the other person has seen your message. It's written in Laravel and heavily relies on asynchronous requests.</p>

<p><strong>
    All the basic chat functionalities have been integrated and everything works correctly.
    The application is not real-time yet, meaning that you have to refresh the chat window manually to see new messages. I'll add web sockets and fix this as soon as I have time.
